5,16,2018,Wednesday,7:00,AM ,Decoding the Past,Prophecies of Israel,1,28,PG,N,"The Tanakh of the Jews is an acronym that identifies the Hebrew Bible, equivalent to the Old Testament to Christians. Within the 24 books of the Tanakh (or Mikra as it was called during the period of its recording) are astounding predictions of the future. Many of the prophets who authored or appeared in the scriptures prophesied about the fate of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. We'll examine the prophecies and chronicle the birth, death, recent resurrection, and possible future of Israel. Supported by archival footage and dramatic recreations, on-camera experts representing the three major religions, and secular perspectives, we explore the most significant of these ancient prophecies. Are the prophecies real? Are they unfolding before our eyes? Who believes, who doesn't, and why?"
5,16,2018,Wednesday,8:00,AM ,Decoding the Past,Mysteries of the Garden of Eden,3,10,PG,N,"The biblical Garden of Eden was taken away from man because of his sins. The Bible says Eden was located east of Israel where four rivers meet--The Tigris and Euphrates and the Pison and Gihon. The later two have long been considered mythical; however recent satellite photography suggests these rivers did exist in Iraq. Another theory places Eden's location beneath the Black Sea. Do texts other than the Bible reinforce the idea of Eden? Both the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh and Ancient Greek texts speak of a paradise lost. Sift through the evidence to decode an age-old mystery about how paradise was lost, and where it might be found."
5,16,2018,Wednesday,9:00,AM ,Decoding the Past,The Real Sorcerer's Stone,2,36,PG,N,"Today, the sorcerer's stone is seen as fiction off the pages of Harry Potter, but in the Middle Ages the quest for the sorcerer's stone was second only to that of the Holy Grail. The stone was actually said to have the power to transform base metals into gold and grant long life--even immortality. The ingredients were hidden in bizarrely coded manuscripts by alchemists who lived within their own secret society. The processes needed to combine them could be dangerous--even deadly. Today, we owe most of our modern lab equipment and experimental techniques to the efforts of these alchemists. Was their search for immortality really on sound scientific ground and did some, as is still rumored, actually succeed?"
5,16,2018,Wednesday,10:00,AM ,Decoding the Past,Nazi Prophecies,1,12,PG,N,"Some say that the rise of Nazi Germany was foretold in prophecies that began in biblical times and continued for centuries until the emergence of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. These predictions paint a chilling portrait of an evil, sinister force that would terrorize the world. We expose the prophecies throughout history that foresaw Hitler's rise and fall. The program includes biblical prophecies in the Book of Ester and the Book of Daniel, the haunting predictions of Nostradamus, the disturbing and exact predictions of Hitler's personal clairvoyant Eric Jan Hanussen, and more...much more. Plus, we delve into the roots of Nazism, including Germanic and Aryan legends, the occult, mysticism, and astrology."

This is the true tale of the original mad scientist, born in 1673, in the famous gothic Frankenstein Castle that overlooked Germany's Rhine Valley. His pioneering work would lead to electric shock therapy used in modern medicine. It was at Frankenstein Castle that Dipple would carry out his search to brew a secret elixir of life. He began to dig up fresh corpses from the nearby Nieder-Beerbach cemetery and dragged them to his laboratory in Castle Frankenstein to test out his formulas. Ironically, it was his potions that finally killed him."
5,16,2018,Wednesday,12:00,PM,Special,101 Inventions That Changed the World,998,998,PG,N,"It starts with a spark, but some ideas catch fire and in the process change the world. Necessity is the mother of invention--from darkness, man found light (the candle) and from even the farthest distances we can still find each other (the telephone). But some inventions have transformed our lives far beyond our homes (the steam engine), our planet (the telescope), and our wildest dreams (the Internet). This countdown highlights how human ingenuity comes in all shapes and sizes.

There was an all too apparent parallel of a country heading towards its own iceberg and sinking. The story of the Nazi Titanic had an unpleasant sting in its tail.

Clues hidden in Da Vinci's paintings, his re-discovered prophetic ""riddles"" and the events of his life now suggest that he, too, was influenced by the Nostradamus Effect. 400 years ago, Da Vinci may have intercepted signs and warnings as early as his boyhood. He witnessed a devastating flood that ravaged his city and that seems to have haunted him with depictions of a watery apocalypse similar to the biblical great flood. Are the clues Da Vinci hid within his writings, his sketches and his masterpieces, all a secret code pointing to a great deluge that will wipe out all mankind?"

But was this evil genius also... a prophet? And did he imagine that his sociopathic visions and violent behavior would eventually overtake the world, even if he was no longer alive to see it himself? Hitler's unlikely ascent was spurred by the eerie prophecies of two famed seers, Nostradamus and Erik Jan Hanussen; Hitler would manipulate their work to anoint himself a self-proclaimed Messiah come to save Germany in its time of need. Instead, he plundered Europe leaving millions dead in his wake. Was he the third Antichrist that Nostradamus predicted?

The Apostle Paul foresaw a moment when all Christians would suddenly be caught up into the air with their Messiah. This would occur prior to the final outpouring of God's wrath upon the wicked. Even Native America Hopi predicted the faithful would be taken off the Earth in advance of a final war between good and evil.

The ancients had heroic tales about Zeus, Thor, and Hanuman while today we have superhero stories about Superman, Batman, and Spider-man. Mythologists say these epic stories resemble each other because they may have all come from a common set of oral legends created eons ago by our earliest ancestors.

Who told Joan of Arc how to defeat the English Army--saints or extraterrestrials? Could a young boy from India have learned advanced mathematical formulas from a Hindu goddess?

In Utah, petroglyphs depict strange beings wearing what look like space suits. In southern California, 19th century ranchers reported seeing an otherworldly creature emerge from Elizabeth Lake. And even in Tombstone, Arizona, the home of Wyatt Earp and the site of the gunfight at the O.K.

But if true, where do these individuals get their visions? According to ancient mythologies, there is a universal repository of knowledge known as the Akashic Record. While most mainstream scholars relegate this to the realm of mythology, recent scientific discoveries have opened the possibility that such a repository could actually exist--and is accessible by the human mind. Giorgio A. Tsoukalos meets with neuroscientist Dr. Dario Nardi to measure the brainwaves of Dr. Deepak Chopra as he enters a state of deep meditation to observe the physical chnges in the brain as he connects or taps into something beyond ourselves. Could our ability to tap into the Akashic Record lead to the next giant leap in human evolution--and connect us to other intelligent beings throughout the cosmos?"

The crime sent shockwaves through New Orleans as the locals searched for answers. Did Zack's experience in the Iraq War years before cause him to do the unthinkable? Or, as some locals speculate, was Zack the victim of a demonic possession brought on during the aftermath of Katrina...creating the perfect storm of hungry spirits and vulnerable prey?"

But a mere mile down the road from the fair, one man, H.H. Holmes, was making history in a far more sinister way. He had built a hotel designed for murder, which would later be known as ""The Murder Castle."" It was a three-story, block-long hotel designed with trap doors, gas chambers and vats of acid all meant to aid a madman in his efforts to murder 200 people. Today, the spirits of Holmes' forgotten victims appear to astonished witnesses, attempting to tell the truth behind a story that remains shrouded in mystery over 100 years later. From Holmes' hometown in New Hampshire, to the site of his hotel in Chicago, to the final resting place of his youngest victim in Indiana, voices and visions reveal the shocking truth behind one of most evil men in America's history and the country's first serial killer."
6,8,2018,Friday ,10:00,AM ,Haunted History,Lost Souls of Pennhurst,1,4,PG,N,"In 1908 Pennhurst Asylum in eastern Pennsylvania was built to house and care for epileptic, disabled and ""feeble-minded"" patients, but after a few years Pennhurst became dangerously overcrowded, thanks in large part to the controversial Eugenics movement sweeping the country. As patients flowed in, the staff became overwhelmed. The result was rampant abuse, neglect and horrific conditions. After almost 80 years in operation Pennhurst was finally shut down, thanks to the heroic efforts of a local journalist and a few brave former patients. However, the spirits of the patients and abusive employees still roam the halls of the asylum today, sending chilling messages to visitors and reminding them of the tragic lessons learned during one of the darkest times in American history."
6,8,2018,Friday ,11:00,AM ,Haunted History,The Manson Murders,1,1,14,N,"In 1969, Hollywood was at the center of a brutal and sadistic killing spree. Charles Manson and his cult of followers began a prolific reign of terror on Tinsel Town, when they viciously killed more than half a dozen innocent people. Today, the sites of these horrific murders are host to claims of the paranormal. The restless spirit of Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate, are believed to haunt a house on Cielo Drive. Not far from the house is another famous Hollywood home, where Sharon Tate is believed to have witnessed a premonition of her own death. And at the Manson Family hideout, an apparition of a headless Donald ""Shorty"" Shea is seen standing on a rocky ledge. Decades after the senseless killings, these locations are still plagued by these paranormal events."

Could some of our most crippling plagues and epidemics be traced to the darkest voids of space--or even extraterrestrial intervention? During the Black Death of the Middle Ages, people reported bronze flying ships emitting a strange mist. As recently as 2011, NASA scientist Richard Hoover published evidence of life in meteorites. Is it possible that ancient aliens--as small as microbes--have shaped human history?"
6,8,2018,Friday ,1:00,PM,Ancient Aliens,Prophets and Prophecies,5,7,PG,N,"They were the messengers of divine knowledge and seers who shared visions of the future. For thousands of years, human civilization has been guided by the words and deeds of ancient prophets, but just who--or what--were these prophets communicating with? Might the experiences of history's prophets be evidence of communication with a heavenly source--or were seers like Elijah and Joseph Smith actually communicating with extraterrestrial overlords? And if so, are there similar prophets at work today?"
6,8,2018,Friday ,2:00,PM,Ancient Aliens,The Mission,1,3,14,N,"If ancient aliens visited Earth, what was their mission, and is there evidence that points to when they will return? Ancient Sumerian tablets describe an alien race, known as the Anunnaki, who came to Earth to mine for gold. Egyptian hieroglyphs depict hybrid creatures that were part man, part animal. Mysterious crop circles and unexplainable crystal skulls are thought to contain messages that man has yet to decipher. Strange evidence may exist in multiple cultures throughout history suggesting that aliens came here to explore, excavate raw materials, experiment on human beings, and even for pure conquest."
6,8,2018,Friday ,4:00,PM,Ancient Aliens,Beyond Nazca,5,8,PG,N,"Erich von Daniken's landmark book, Chariots of the Gods, brought attention to the mysterious phenomena of the Nazca Lines. Hundreds of gigantic lines, some in the shape of animals, geometric patterns and even an alien-like being, extend for miles throughout a remote Peruvian desert. Scholars are divided as to who built them, and why. Some Ancient Astronaut theorists believe that the massive markings have an extraterrestrial connection, and perhaps the ancient people of the region created these gigantic figures in tribute to the gods who visited them. And with one of the largest deposits of nitrates in the world--a key ingredient in rocket fuel and weaponry--could Nazca have been a mining operation for advanced beings in the distant past?"
6,8,2018,Friday ,5:00,PM,Ancient Aliens,Magic of the Gods,6,4,PG,N,"Wondrous wizards... Mysterious sorcerers... And heavenly beings... possessed of unimaginable power. Throughout the ancient world, magic was used for everything from healing to communicating with the gods. But did magic really exist in the ancient times? Not as a form of theater--but as a means of replicating the power of the gods? Do ancient accounts of magic suggest evidence of advanced, otherworldly knowledge? A knowledge given to early humans as a means of helping them unlock their own--some might say ""divine""--potential?"
6,8,2018,Friday ,6:00,PM,Ancient Aliens,The New Evidence,11,4,PG,N,"Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings. What if it were true? This is the question Ancient Astronaut theorists have posed since Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods was first published in 1968; examining scientific, archaeological, astronomical, and historical evidence to find the answer. In recent years, more new evidence has been revealed than ever before that suggests there was extraterrestrial intervention on Earth in the distant past. Satellite images have exposed geoglyphs resembling Nazca lines in Kazakhstan. Ground penetrating radar has detected remnants of ancient technology in Machu Picchu. And thermal scanning has uncovered hidden chambers behind King Tut's tomb that may hold the remains of extraterrestrial beings. Could we be at the tipping point where the overwhelming evidence outweighs any last shred of doubt?"
6,8,2018,Friday ,7:00,PM,Ancient Aliens,The Alien Frequency,12,8,PG,N,"The use of mantras and chanting to connect with a higher plane has existed in cultures all over the world dating back thousands of years, but why would people who had no contact with each other all subscribe to this practice? Could there be certain frequencies that connect us with greater--perhaps extraterrestrial--forces? Researchers have found that dozens of megalithic sites stretching across the globe--like the prehistoric Newgrange monument in Ireland, the chiseled labyrinths underneath the island of Malta, and the giant temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia--were all designed to emanate the exact same frequency. The planets in our solar system each give off a distinct sound, and certain places on Earth, like Taos, New Mexico, have been found to produce a hum from an unknown source. Might the best evidence of alien intervention on Earth be found not with our eyes... but with our ears?"
